*This is a can of worms I should not have dared to open*

Click [here](https://github.com/theinvisiblefish13/sprayPaintMadness/blob/main/paint%20FINAL.lua) to get to the script if you don't know how to use GitHub lol

This script will allow you to put **any PNG image imaginable** into the Roblox game [Spray Paint!](https://www.roblox.com/games/5991163185)
The PNG must not be too large, or it will crash you (or just not work). Reccomended size for fast drawing is under 128x128.

The majority of the instructions are contained within the big script comment, so read them before using.

There is a mode called **raycast mode**, and this will allow you to follow the contours of any surface. It only works from a distance (or it will just clip into the ground), so freecam is basically a must.
***Raycast mode has awkward centering because I'm retarded with CFrames and too lazy to fix it, it originates from the top center instead of the center***

This script was made for **Synapse X**, but *will work with other executors* that have their own HTTP request function.
If you are using another executor, simply follow what the comments say to replace the functions.

I have no idea who made the original image parser script but I found it [here](https://v3rmillion.net/showthread.php?tid=1000776) and just took a part the inside of the module.
