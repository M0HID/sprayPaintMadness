*This is a can of worms I should not have dared to open*

This script will allow you to put **any PNG image imaginable** into the Roblox game [Spray Paint!](https://www.roblox.com/games/5991163185)
The PNG must not be too large, or it will crash you (or just not work). Reccomended size for fast drawing is under 128x128.

There is a mode called **raycast mode**, and this will allow you to follow the contours of any surface. It only works from a distance (or it will just clip into the ground), so freecam is basically a must.
***raycast mode has awkward centering because I'm retarded with CFrames and too lazy to fix it, it originates from the top center instead of the center***

The majority of the instructions are contained within the big script comment, so read them before using.

This script was made for **Synapse X**, but *will work with other executors* that have their own HTTP request function.
If you are using another executor, simply follow what the comments say to replace the functions.

I have no idea who made the original image parser script but I found it [here](https://v3rmillion.net/showthread.php?tid=1000776) and just took a part the inside of the module.
